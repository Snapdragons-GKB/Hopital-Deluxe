## 9/7
Notes as of yet:
I had to change the secret key (ripped it from Hopital-Scheduler, which is oldest) and the debug setting. To run this on production we will need to go to settings and change it back. I just commented out the relevant sections, so we would just undo and comment out their replacements. This should now be running on localhost.

Note also, changed the database to Hopital-Deluxe, so will need to account for that.

## Later this day

Install django-simple-bulma.
