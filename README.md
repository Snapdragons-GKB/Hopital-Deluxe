# HopitalScheduler ReadMe
## Description :calendar: :face_with_head_bandage:
Hopital Scheduler was named after l'Hôpital because I was bored. It was created to mimick and support surgery scheduling procedures by giving patients the ability to request operations at their chosen time. Hopital also works to reduce the confusion that comes with Insurance coverage and scheduling by being a one stop shop for both patients and providers.

## Technologies Used 
Hopital Scheduler is a full stack application built with Django, PostgreSQL, and idiocy.
# User Stories 
- As a new patient, I want to quickly navigate to where I can request/book time with a physician so that I don’t have to waste my time on hold.
- As a patient with private insurance or Medicare/Medicaid, I only want to see providers that accept my insurance or Medicare/Medicaid so that my care is covered.
- As an elderly patient who is unfamiliar with technology, I want to use a very clear/well-organized page that will not prevent me from seeking care due to irritation with the setup of the page.
- As a patient, I do not want the full details of my illness/injury/condition to be available to anyone other than my healthcare provider so that my rights to privacy are respected
- As a surgery scheduler, I want to be able to approve patient requests for appointments so that my workload is lessened by not having to determine this information for myself by speaking with every patient.
- As a surgery scheduler, I want to be able to see only a simple description of the patient’s illness/injury/condition so I can allow them to book with the providers that are best suited to their illness/injury/condition without disrespecting their rights to privacy.
- As a physician, I want patient bookings to appear on my personal schedule so I understand what my workday looks like.
- As a physician, I do not want my full schedule to be available to anyone other than the surgery scheduler so that my rights to privacy are respected.
## Stretch 
- As a returning patient, I want to see a log of my past appointments/the doctors I’ve seen so I can review my medical history.
- As a physician, I want all the information on the patient’s illness/injury/condition that they supplied so that I can prepare accordingly for their consultation.
